# Store Management System

This Store management system lets permitted users access their respective functionality.
All of the stores modules work together to create a fully functional Store Management System.

## Project Explanation

This project uses a 3-tier architecture and is written in Java. There are 4 main modules: Store, Employee, Supplier and Shipment.
8 people worked on this project (2 for each module).
The modules were integrated in 2 iterations - 
  1. We integrated Employee & Supplier and Store & Shipment seperately.
  2. Later we integrated all of the modules together.
This is a CLI project.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the system:
1. Download the repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory named 'release'.
3. Run the following command: java -jar adss2021_v03.jar
4. The first prompt is meant for the tester. If you press 1, some basic data will be initialized into the system. Any other number will create an empty system.
5. A default admin user is already initialized into the system, so you can use it to access the different modules. User ID: admin.
